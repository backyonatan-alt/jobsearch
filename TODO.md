# TODO

Time-bound items. Cross off as completed. Things that don't have a date go in `CLAUDE.md` roadmap, not here.

## This week (v0.1 — spine)

- [x] Repo scaffold, Go module, Postgres migrations runner
- [x] `users`, `sessions`, `magic_links`, `applications` schema
- [x] Magic-link auth endpoints (`/api/auth/request`, `/api/auth/verify`)
- [x] Applications CRUD endpoints behind auth middleware
- [x] Static frontend shell (login → app shell → application list/kanban)
- [x] systemd unit + nginx config samples in `deploy/`
- [x] GH Actions CI (build/test) + deploy stub for Hetzner
- [ ] Provision Hetzner VM (CX22), run `deploy/bootstrap.sh` (uses `<ip>.nip.io` as the hostname — no domain needed for the beta)
- [ ] Add GH Actions secrets (`DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_USER`, `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`) + var `DEPLOY_ENABLED=true`, push to main → first deploy
- [ ] First end-to-end: open the URL, request a magic link, grab it from `journalctl -u jobsearch`, add 3 real applications
- [ ] Wire Postmark mail driver (gated by `MAIL_DRIVER=postmark`) — required before sending invites to friends, not before
- [ ] Send invite links to 3 friends for the closed beta

## Next (v0.2 — ingest + dossier)

- [ ] LinkedIn job URL paste → backend fetch + parse → prefilled new-application form
- [ ] `.ics` paste/upload → interview event linked to application
- [ ] Anthropic API integration (Claude) with prompt caching on the system prompt
- [ ] Interviewer dossier endpoint + frontend card

## Pre-launch (before sending the first invite)

- [ ] Postmark account + `MAIL_DRIVER=postmark` wired in
- [ ] Privacy note: closed beta, what we store, retention policy. Even one paragraph.
- [ ] Backup story for Postgres: nightly `pg_dump` → off-VM (S3 or Hetzner Storage Box)
- [ ] A single Plausible (or GA4) property wired into the frontend

## Parked decisions

- Domain name (pursuit.app etc.) — deferred until after beta validates demand. Running on `<ip>.nip.io` with a real Lets-Encrypt cert until then.

## Parked (post-beta)

- Post-interview recording analysis — privacy/consent decision required first
- CV A/B with per-variant tracking — needs volume to show signal, build in v2
- Payments / public signup
- Custom domain swap (DNS + nginx server_name + cert reissue)
